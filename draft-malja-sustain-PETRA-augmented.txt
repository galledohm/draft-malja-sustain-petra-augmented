1.  Introduction

   Sustainability is becoming one of the major societal goals for the
   next decade, and networks are one of the major consumers of energy
   nowadays.  Sustainability of network services is thus one of the
   forefronts of innovation and action from network service
   stakeholders, involving manufacturers, operators and customers.  In
   this line, there is a shared goal of achieving better energy
   awareness.

   As with any other network metric, the energy traffic ratio could be
   collected from the underlying network infrastructure.  However, there
   is not a common or single definition of energy metrics towards
   network consumers so that can be uniformly reported, particularly in
   heterogeneous network scenarios.  This document introduces an API to
   query networks about Energy Traffic Ratio.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Path Energy Traffic Ratio API (PETRA)

   This documents describes an API to query a network about the Energy
   Traffic Ratio for a given path.  It takes as input the source and
   destination of a path along with the traffic throughput between and
   returns energy information related to the traffic on the path.  This
   is energy computed by the infrastructure that is dynamically part of
   the traffic path.  The API is agnostic to the actual hops and
   underlaying infrastructure that enables a path, which might change
   transparently to the API.  This document only describes the API, the
   computation of the energy information to return is out of the scope
   of this document.

3.1.  Energy Information

   This API allows to return a number of energy attributes associated
   with the path and the traffic.  Currently the parameters that could
   be returned as energy information as part of the query are:

   *  Watts per Gigabit: How many Watts are consumed per Gigabit of
      traffic traversing the path.

   *  Carbon Intensity: How much carbon emissions are generated as a
      consequence of the energy consumed.  Some other parameters that
      could be considered as well as part of the energy information
      include:

   *  Renewable Percentage: How much of the energy consumed comes from
      renewable energy sources.

   *  ...

3.2.  Recursive Usage

   The API is envisioned in such a way that could be used recursively.
   That means, subpaths could report their energy consumption using
   PETRA and such energy consumption could be aggregated and reported
   for the overall path also using PETRA.

   Similarly, this API could be (recursively) used to provide energy
   information according to the definition of Service Models in an SDN
   context as described in [RFC8309].  In that case, using Figure 3 in
   [RFC8309] as reference, PETRA could be used between the Controller(s)
   and the Network Orchestrator(s), between the Network Orchestrator(s)
   and the Service Orchestrator, and between the Service Orchestrator
   and the Customer(s).

   While considering recursive usage, the aspect of double-counting
   shall also be taken into consideration.  Double counting refers to
   the fact of counting more than once the same energy consumed.
   Organizations using PETRA in a recursive manner need to take
   appropriate measures to ensure no double-counting occurs across
   recursive calls to the API.

4.  YANG Module

   This is a posible definition of PETRA as a module following the YANG
   specification [RFC6020].

4.1.  Module Structure

   module: ietf-petra
     +--rw energy
        +---x query
           +---w input
           |  +---w src-ip        ietf-inet-types:ip-address
           |  +---w dst-ip        ietf-inet-types:ip-address
           |  +---w throughput    uint32
           +--ro output
              +--ro (result)?
                 +--:(success)
                 |  +--ro success
                 |     +--ro watts-per-gigabit?   decimal64
                 |     +--ro carbon-intensity?    uint32
                 +--:(invalid-address)
                    +--ro invalid-address
